This project was built in Java and is used by the UWEC Recreation department to generate HTML that will display images in an overlay element.
The program takes in inputs from the user such as the amount of photos, photo names, numbered sequentially, etc. It does this using JOptionPanes.
Once the user specifies needed inputs the code to add to Commonspot( the CMS used by the recreation department) is generated in a txt document on whatever directory contains the program.
